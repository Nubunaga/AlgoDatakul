/**
 * This code were implemented to solve the riddle on how stdin and stdout works on C. 
 * This is a good exaple of an "end of fil√© use of the program and how to implement it correctly.
 * this works by setting a while loop untill the condition is found that it is an end of file
 * EOF, untill then each new press or file will print out a new char to stdout.
